/*! \mainpage Index page for Project: Bus System Simulator
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The following pages contain UML documentation for Bus System Simulator
 *
 * How to obtain the code:
 * 	To obtain the code navigate to the website
 * http://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081-s20/repo-kunkl007
 * From here you have a few options of how you can obtain the project. You can
 * either download the files and unzip them, then navigate to project.
 * Alternatively, create a folder and navigate to it through the command line
 * and type "git clone http://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081-s20/repo-kunkl007.git".
 * This will create a copy of the entire file structure and you will have to
 * navigate to the "project" folder to see the project we will be referring to
 * for the rest of this document. To compile the code, further navigate to the
 * src folder by type "cd src/" in the command line. Here you will want to type
 * and enter "make clean" then "make". This should compile the project for you
 * to be able to run. Type "cd .." to navigate back to project. From here you
 * will want to type "./build/bin/vis_sim 8123". The command line should print
 * "starting server...". At this point you'll want to open your internet
 * browser and enter "http://127.0.0.1:8123/web_graphics/project.html" At
 * this point the command line should say "Connection established". From the
 * webpage you can choose how many steps you want to run of the simulation with
 * the top scroll bar. The bottom bars let you choose how many steps you want to
 * wait in between spawning new busses. The final step is to click
